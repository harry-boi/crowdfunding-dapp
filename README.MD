  - Wallet connection (e.g., MetaMask)
  - Campaign management (e.g., creating campaigns, viewing progress)
  - Real-time data fetching via the backend.

#### 2. Backend (`/backend`)

- **Technology**: Node.js with Express.
- **Purpose**: Serves as the middle layer for API calls, handling logic and communication between the frontend and the blockchain.
- **Deployment**: Suitable for deployment on services like AWS, Heroku, or Render.
- **Key Features**:
  - Campaign data retrieval and filtering.
  - Custom APIs for interacting with the smart contracts.

#### 3. Smart Contracts (`/smart-contracts`)

- **Technology**: Solidity with Foundry for development and testing.
- **Purpose**: The core of the DApp, managing campaign creation, funding, and withdrawals on the blockchain.
- **Deployment**: Deployed on Ethereum or other EVM-compatible networks.
